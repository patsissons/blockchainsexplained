title: Should I buy Bitcoin this holiday season (2023)?
labels: [btc, investment, seasonal, ETF, halving]

# TL;DR

Almost certainly no. Bitcoin is a higher risk long-term investment, and you should not buy it if you are expecting to _make a quick return_, especially if this is from a _hot tip you got from your uncle_. If you are willing to hold it for **5+ years**, then you may enjoy the investment experience but you should be fully prepared that it could all go to zero.

## ELI5

Buying Bitcoin is like buying pokemon cards that you think will be worth more in the future because people will want to buy them off you. If nobody wants to buy them off you in the future, then the value they hold is the entertainment you get from buying them today. But if everyone likes pokemon in the future then these cards may become desireable with demand, similar to how old video game cartriges have become popular and expensive recently. The value of Bitcoin is determined by how many people want to buy it now, and how many people want to buy it in the future.

## As a beginner

Bitcoin is an asset that is currently worth what people are willing to pay for it, and this number has increased lately for a variety of reasons. Because of how much this number has increased in the past few months, there is an unusual demand for Bitcoin and the topic of owning Bitcoin has become more common, especially during the holiday season as people get together and talk about interesting topics. This has led to a lot of people asking if they should buy Bitcoin, and the answer is that it depends on what you want to do with it and what your risk tolerance is. If you are looking to make easy money then you should probably not buy Bitcoin because you may end up losing money instead of making it. If you are looking to make a long-term investment with money that you're willing to lose, then you may enjoy holding onto the Bitcoin for at a long time with the chance that it becomes valuable in your lifetime.

# Buying Bitcoin

It isn't as easy to buy Bitcoin as it is to buy stocks or bonds. You can't just go to your bank and ask them to buy you some Bitcoin. You need to use a special service that allows you to buy Bitcoin. These services are known as _crypto exchanges_ and they are websites that allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, as well as exchange fiat currency (like USD) into crypto currencies. There are many exchanges, and they all have different features and fees. Some exchanges are more risky than others, as an exchange is the owner of any Bitcoin that you buy through them. This means that if the exchange is hacked or goes out of business, you may lose your Bitcoin. It is important to do your research on the exchange you are using to make sure that it is reputable and trustworthy.

# Why is Bitcoin so popular lately?

A very large financial firm called Blackrock recently announced that they are going to start offering a new Bitcoin ETF. This is a big deal because Blackrock is a very large financial services company that manages a lot of money for a lot of people (trillions of US dollars). This means that a lot of people have a reasonable amount of trust in Blackrock to make good decisions with their money. If Blackrock is enabling casual investors to purchase Bitcoin through their ETF then this means that a lot of people will potentially invest in that Bitcoin ETF out of curiosity or to add some crypto exposure to their portfolio. This organic hype about the pending Bitcoin ETF has other speculators thinking that Bitcoin will rise sharply in value as a larger pool of casual investors all of a sudden have easier access to Bitcoin assets.

## The upcoming halving

There is also an upcoming _Bitcoin halving_ event that will occur in 2024. This is an event that occurs every 4 years where the amount of Bitcoin that is rewarded to miners for mining a block is cut in half. This means that the supply of new Bitcoin introduced to the system is reduced by half, which is expected to increase the value of Bitcoin because there is less of it available. This is a common event in Bitcoin's history and has historically been followed by a sharp increase in the value of Bitcoin. This is because the supply of Bitcoin is reduced, but the demand for Bitcoin remains the same or increases. This means that the price of Bitcoin will _likely_ increase because there is less of it available to buy.
